More recently he has\r\n                been working to use satellite remote sensing data for\r\n                understanding the climate response of Himalayan Cryosphere and\r\n                Air Quality assessment from Space.\r\n              <br />\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"col-4 \">\r\n              <img\r\n                src={img2}\r\n                className=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\"\r\n                alt=\"...\"\r\n              />\r\n            </div>            \r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n     \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    </>\r\n\r\n    \r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default VisionariesHub"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,2BAA2B;AAC3C,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACvC,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,oBAAoB;AACrC,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,qBAAqB;AACtC,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,+BAA+B;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAEhD,SAASC,cAAcA,CAAA,EAAG;EACxB,oBACEH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACAJ,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC3BJ,OAAA;QAAIK,SAAS,EAAC;MAA4C;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAEtD,CAAC,eACLT,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACnBJ,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;UAAAD,QAAA,eAC1BJ,OAAA;YACEU,GAAG,EAAEd,IAAK;YACVS,SAAS,EAAC,8BAA8B;YACxCM,GAAG,EAAC;UAAK;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACV;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACC,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACpBJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAAwB;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAEjCT,OAAA;YAAGY,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAAT,QAAA,GAAC,wRAMlC,eAAAJ,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,iNAKL,eAAAT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC,iZAQR;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC,eAENT,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAD,QAAA,eAC7BJ,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAClBJ,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACpBJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAAa;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAEtBT,OAAA;YAAGY,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAAT,QAAA,GAAC,siBAUlC,eAAAJ,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACL,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAD,QAAA,eACrBJ,OAAA;YACEU,GAAG,EAAEhB,GAAI;YACTW,SAAS,EAAC,8BAA8B;YACxCM,GAAG,EAAC;UAAK;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACV;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACC,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC7BJ,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAClBJ,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAD,QAAA,eACrBJ,OAAA;YACEU,GAAG,EAAEZ,IAAK;YACVO,SAAS,EAAC,8BAA8B;YACxCM,GAAG,EAAC;UAAK;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACV;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACC,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACpBJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAAc;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvBT,OAAA;YAAGY,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAAT,QAAA,GAAC,8RAMlC,eAAAJ,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACL,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAAAD,QAAA,eAC7BJ,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAClBJ,OAAA;YAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACpBJ,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;YAAkB;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAE3BT,OAAA;cAAGY,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAAT,QAAA,GAAC,s5BAiBlC,eAAAJ,OAAA;gBAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAK,CAAC,0gBAUR,eAAAT,OAAA;gBAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAK,CAAC;YAAA;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACH,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC,eAENT,OAAA;YAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;YAAAD,QAAA,eACrBJ,OAAA;cACEU,GAAG,EAAEf,IAAK;cACVU,SAAS,EAAC,8BAA8B;cACxCM,GAAG,EAAC;YAAK;cAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACV;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACC,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC;EAAA,eAIN,CAAC;AAIP;AAACK,EAAA,GA/IQX,cAAc;AAiJvB,eAAeA,cAAc;AAAA,IAAAW,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
